# Scanner
# THM room: Custom Tooling Using Python

'''
In this task, we are not testing advanced payloads, as dedicated tools like sqlmap (also written in Python) perform advanced automated SQL injection testing. Our goal is to understand the basics of scanning and how Python can be used to detect vulnerabilitie
